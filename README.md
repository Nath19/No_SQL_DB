# Not-only-SQL Databases ðŸ’» 

## In this repository  we will see four of the most popular nosql databases.


#### What is NoSQL?

NoSQL databases are designed to support cloud application requirements and overcome the scale, performance, data model and data distribution limitations of traditional relational databases (RDBMSâ€™s).

A NoSQL (Not-only-SQL) database stores, distributes and accesses data using methods that differ from relational databases (RDBMSâ€™s). Internet leaders, such as Facebook, Google and Amazon, originally created and used the NoSQL technology because these tech-giants required massively scalable database management systems that could write and read data anywhere in the world, while delivering performance and availability to billions of users.

Today, most companies and organizations must also deliver large scale applications that personalize their customerâ€™s experience. NoSQL is the database technology of choice for powering such systems.

### How NoSQL Differs from Relational Databases ?? 
NoSQL and RDBMS databases support different application requirements and frequently co-exist in enterprises to support different use cases. The key technological decision criteria include the following

# Mongodb

MongoDB is a document database with the scalability and flexibility that you want with the querying and indexing that you need. MongoDBâ€™s document model is simple for developers to learn and use, while still providing all the capabilities needed to meet the most complex requirements at any scale.

# Elastic Search

Elasticsearch is a distributed, open-source search and analytics engine built on Apache Lucene and developed in Java. It started as a scalable version of the Lucene open-source search framework then added the ability to horizontally scale Lucene indices. Elasticsearch allows you to store, search, and analyze huge volumes of data quickly and in near real-time and give back answers in milliseconds. Itâ€™s able to achieve fast search responses because instead of searching the text directly, it searches an index. It uses a structure based on documents instead of tables and schemas and comes with extensive REST APIs for storing and searching the data. At its core, you can think of Elasticsearch as a server that can process JSON requests and give you back JSON data.

# Cassandra

Apache Cassandraâ„¢ is a distributed NoSQL database that delivers continuous availability, high performance, and linear scalability that successful applications require.

Apache Cassandra is an open source, distributed NoSQL database that began internally at Facebook and was released as an open-source project in July 2008. Cassandra delivers continuous availability (zero downtime), high performance, and linear scalability that modern applications require, while also offering operational simplicity and effortless replication across data centers and geographies. Cassandra can handle petabytes of information and thousands of concurrent operations per second, enabling organizations to manage large amounts of data across hybrid cloud and multi cloud environments.

# Neo4j
Neo4j is a native graph database, built from the ground up to leverage not only data but also data relationships. Neo4j connects data as itâ€™s stored, enabling queries never before imagined, at speeds never thought possible. Unlike traditional databases, which arrange data in rows, columns and tables, Neo4j has a flexible structure defined by stored relationships between data records.
With Neo4j, each data record, or node, stores direct pointers to all the nodes itâ€™s connected to. Because Neo4j is designed around this simple, yet powerful optimization, it performs queries with complex connections orders of magnitude faster, and with more depth, than other databases.
